# Welcome to Qwerky Studio

This app intended to facilitate image coordination between various AI image generators, as well as a site builder store such as SquareSpace. This is a living project and we're not 100% sure of its direction, but the motivation came from me wanting to set up a squarespace store to sell products that featured artwork I'd created using Dall-E. From there, its anyone's guess. But Im' sure we can make something interesting out of it üõ©Ô∏è
