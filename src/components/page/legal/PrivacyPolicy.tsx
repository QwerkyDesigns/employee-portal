        contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

        #### Place

        The Data is processed at the Owner&#39;s operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.

        transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.

        may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.

        Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot
        be enforced after expiration of the retention period.
