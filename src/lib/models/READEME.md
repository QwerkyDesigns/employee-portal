## Module Description

Hi all ðŸ˜„ - This module is not a database model module! Sorry for the confusion.

These models are classes that hold data. Thats it. Like records in c# - only we don't have those. We just have objects.

I did this so that I could whip together the prototype quickly. We can move over to whatever the best practice is in JS when we feel its
time to pay off that bit of technical debt .

Thanks ðŸ˜‰
